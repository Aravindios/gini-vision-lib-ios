2.0.0-stub.1 (2016-07-14)
=========================

- Stub version of the completely rewritten Gini Vision Library using Swift.
- Provides two integration options. An easy to implement Screen API and a more complex more flexible Component API. Both APIs are easily configurable using a `GINIConfiguration` object.
- For communication between your app and the Library use the `GINIVisionDelegate` for the Screen API or pass according closures/blocks when using the Component API.
- This stub release implements all calls for the future 2.0.0 release. It allows a user to capture a document and review it. Also screens for onboarding and further analysis are provided. Until the final release the UI will be further improved and eventually minor changes are made to the implementations.
