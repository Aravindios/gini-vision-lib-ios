2.0.0-stub.2 (2016-07-15)
=========================

- Stub version of the completely rewritten Gini Vision Library using Swift.
- Provides two integration options: 1) A Screen API ​that can easily be implemented. 2) A more complex ​but at the same time​ more flexible Component API. Both APIs are ​easy to configure by using ​the `GINIConfiguration` object.
- For ​the​ communication between your app and the Library use the `GINIVisionDelegate` for the Screen API or pass according closures/blocks when using the Component API.
- This stub release implements all calls for the future 2.0.0 release. It allows ​the​ user to capture a document and review it. Also screens for onboarding and further analysis are provided. ​For​ the final release the UI will be further improved and minor changes are made ​in​ the implementations ​if really necessary​.
