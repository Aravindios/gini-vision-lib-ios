/**
 Convenience class to interact with the Gini Vision Library.
 
 The Gini Vision Library provides views for capturing, reviewing and analysing documents.
 
 By integrating this library in your application you can allow your users to easily take pictures of documents, review them and - by implementing the necessary callbacks - upload the document for analysis to the Gini API.
 
 The Gini Vision Library can be integrated in two ways, either by using the **Screen API** or the **Component API**. The Screen API provides a fully pre-configured navigation controller for easy integration, while the Component API provides single view controllers for advanced integration with more freedom for customisation.
